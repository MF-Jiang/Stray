I wish I could help you more, but as you can see I'm very busy. Alas, I want to take this cookie to my son who hasn't eaten yet, but unfortunately I can't do it right now

K: 
Meow (I can help you)

D: 
Hahaha, does that mean you want to help me? Wait, that might work. Okay kitty, please deliver this cookie to my son Cody at the **gas station**. He must be starving.

D: 
Watch out ahead. When you come to a place where you can't walk, you may need to **jump** over.
